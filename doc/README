Installation guide
General stuff
To install this program you need `libm.so` and `libSDL2.so` (see `Installation notes`) dynamic libraries.
Then perform: 
```bash
sh ./autogen.sh
./configure
make
sudo make install
```
After that, run `ldconfig(8)`.  Do `sudo ldconfig`, there's no harm in it.

Installation notes
You can build ProCalc without SDL (SDL2), but it will have limited functionality. If you are sure, that you have `libSDL2.so` installed on your system, you can specify its path via `LDFLAGS`. For that, instead of `./configure` run `./configure LDFLAGS=-L/path/to/SDL2/lib`. To specify `SDL2.h` use `./configure CPPFLAGS=-I /path/to/SDL2/header`
